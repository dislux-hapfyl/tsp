# Intelligence

Years ago when I was a high-school student, once our Chemistry teacher wanted take an oral quiz from us. He randomly chose a student, brought him to the blackboard and asked him an unusual question. Why does a proton has positive electrical charge, while an electron has negative electrical charge? Why isn't it the other way round?

The question has a fairly simple answer, negativity and positivity are merely names assigned to these primitive particles, so that we can analyze their behaviors. The question is like asking why humans with male reproductive systems are called men, while humans with female reproductive systems are called women? The student got confused and couldn't answer the question anyway. I still adore that teacher for asking these kind of meta-questions, because sometimes, learning is not all about memorizing things.

Genders and electrical charges are not the only dualities in our universe. In fact, we have infinite concepts in our unverse that has duals. Good and bad, happiness and sadness, light and dark, love and hate, forward and backward, angel and devil, heaven and hell, or even zeros and ones in our computers, they are all examples of dualities.

In many of these duals, one thing refers to the presence of something while the other things refers to the absence of that thing. In context of zeros and  ones, we can say one refers to existence of some quantity while zero defines absence of it.

There is a famous saying, that love and hate are two sides of the same coin. In fact, all duals are actually the sides of a single coin. A coin would not exist if it didn't have two sides. That's also true for all other duals. Happiness wouldn't exist if there wasn't any sadness. Positive numbers wouldn't exist if there weren't any negative numbers (If we didn't have negative numbers, our algebra would become bugos).

Here are some other coin samples and their analogical sides!

 - Data is the coin, zeros and ones are its sides.
 - Feeling is the coin, happiness and sadness are its sides.
 - Ethics is the coin, good and bad are its sides.
 - Emotion is the coin, love and hate are its sides.

You can see that many of these interesting phenomena emerge when we try to pull "numbness" from two sides and break it into into two pieces that when come together again, they become numb again. (E.g You feel numb when you are neither happy or sad or you get zero when you add the negative (dual) of a number to itself).

Some of these halvenings are conceptual, meaning that they are not something emerged in our universe like protons and electrons, or women and men. And example is negative and positive numbers, or real and imaginary numbers. We can somehow argue that negative and positive numbers are things that exist even if our universe does not exist (Or can't we? Nobody knows that at least).

And some of them are reflections of these conceptual Yin and Yangs. The fact that some living creatures have genders only emerged after millions of years of evolution. In fact many living creatures did not have genders and they split into two only after evolution decided to mimick duality, maybe because duality is good.

A hard, solid piece of rock is a creature that perhaps doesn't experience any of the human feelings. A rock doesn't fall in love, or become happy or sad. A rock will experience no pain, doesn't need to breath and eat to survive, you might think that a rock has a wonderful life (And in some ways, it has).

A rock's luckiness perhaps partly comes back to the fact that it has a fairly simple structure. If you study the molecular structure of a rock, you will see that a rock is built of a limited set of atoms, orderly placed along each other, which makes it a very hard break. A human being on the other hand has a much more complicated structure, and we can't see the perfect atomical ordering of a rock in a human body too. While a rock has a wonderful life, its life is very boring (From the viewpoint of an observer), a human life on the other hand, despite having sadness, pain and suffer, is much more interesting and worth living. Nature's goal has never been to build a long-lasting life, without any happiness and pain like a rock, but to build a life that maximizes ***interestigness***.

You might now already know that I'm going to talk about one of the most interesting laws of physics, the second law of thermodynamics. This law was first discovered by Sadi Carnot, the french Physicist, who discovered that you can't build a motor engine that is able to convert 100% of the heat energy into mechanical work, and some of the energy will always be wasted. In other words, there is a efficiency limit in a system that converts heat into mechanical work. The same law can be expressed in other ways too, for example, you can't build a refrigerator (Or an air conditioner) that is able to decrease the temperature of a closed area, without disposing a higher heat (Higher than the amount reduced in the closed area) outside that area.

Heat is some kind of chaos and disorder in atoms. When atoms take energy, they start to move in directions in a chaotic way. The more they move, the hotter they become. We can measure how chaotic the elements of a system (E.g. the atoms inside a closed area) are, and call it the Entropy of that system.

Given the definition of Entropy, we can redefine the second law of thermodynamics in another words: ***The entropy of the universe always increases.*** I.e the sum of disordered-ness of all elements in our universe always gets higher, which again means, I can't decrease the heat in my room in a sunny day without generating even more heat into the universe. You might now think that we are making the earth warmer by building air conditioners, but the truth is the heat is radiated into the universe!

Humans have always had the dream of replicating themselves by building creatures that have the intellectualual abilities of a human (Or even beyond). You can see how much we fantasize about human-made intelligence in the books, paintings, movies and etc.

The struggles in building artificial creatures has a long story, but the very first recorded design of a humanoid robot was done in around 1495 by the famous italian polymath, Leonardo Da Vinci.

If you are here to learn about artificial intelligence algorithms, I’m afraid to say you are in the wrong place. We are mostly going to learn about biological inspired algorithms for reaching AGI, because I believe nature has the answers for most of the questions already.

Long story short, interesting things can emerge as a result of many things gathering together, making “complex” system. People have written many books in this matter, in order to amaze you by the fact that intelligence can evolve by connecting many simple things to each other, but here I assume that you are already amazed and want to know how to actually build those stuff? 

I would like to remind you the first chapter, where we claimed that interesting things can happen when cause and effect chains of the same type are connected together. That's also the building block of a computer, a lot of logic gates connect together to cause desired behaviors. Interestingly, a human/biological brain is also similar to a logical circuits and digital computers in some ways. A lot of smaller units called neurons are connected together, leading to behaviors we typically call intelligence. There is a huge difference between a digital circuit and a biological brain though. A biological brain is made through the process of evolution, while a digital computer is carefully designed and made by a human, baked on pieces of silicone. When you design a digital computer, you exactly know what you want from it. You want it to make your life easier by running calculations and algorithms that take thousands of years when done by hand. When you do know what you exactly want from something, you can organize it into pieces, where each piece does one and only one independent thing very well, and then connect the solutions of subproblems together, solving the original problem. In case of a digital computer, the subproblems are:

* Storing data -> FlipFlop circuits
* Doing math -> Adder circuits
* Running instructions -> Program Counters
* ...

The fact that the original solution is a combination of solutions of subproblems, means that the solution does not have a symmetric structure. By symmetric, I mean you can't expect the part that solves problem A to be also able to solve problem B. You can't expect a memory-cell to be able to add two numbers. Although they both are logical circuits that accept electrical causes as inputs and produce electrical effects as outputs (And thus they can connect to each other), they have whole entirely different structures.

As humans, it is difficult for us to discover and design decentralized solutions for problems, while it is easy for us to break the problem into subproblems, and find solutions for the subproblems instead.

Interestingly, it's completely the way around for the nature. It's much easier for the nature to design decentralized solutions for the problems, but it's hard for it to break the problem into subproblems, and solve the original problem by solving the subproblems.

Perhaps these are all the reasons why biological brains have very solid, symmetrical structures with complex and magical behaviors and why digital computers are very organized and easy to analyze. I would like to call biological brains and digital computers as dynamic brains and static brains respectively.

Let's define a static brain as a network of gates that are static and do not change their behaviors over time. While a dynamic brain is a network of gates in which the gates themselves can change their behavior and turn into other gates. A static brain is a well organized brain designed by an intelligent creature, in which each part does exactly one thing and cannot change its original behavior when needed (E.g An AND gate cannot change into an OR gate), while a dynamic brain is a network of general-purpose gates evolved by the nature to solve more general problems (E.g. maximizing a goal, like survival, pleasure, etc).

An AND gate inside a computer can only act as an AND gate. It can't change itself to an OR gate when needed. A structure like this may seem boring in the first place, since it can only do one thing and can't change its behavior over time (The neurons/gates in a biological brain can transform, leading to different behaviors). But we can actually bring some flexibility and ability to learn by adding a separate concept known as a memory, which can contain a program and an state. The static circuit's only ability is to fetch an instruction from the memory, and change the state of the system from A to B, per clock cycle. The system's ability to learn comes from it's ability to store an state.

In a dynamic brain on the other hand, the learning can happen inside the connections. There isn't a separate module known as memory in a dynamic brain, but the learning happens when the connections between the neurons and the neurons themselves transform. If we are trying to build an artificial general intelligence, it might make more sense to try to mimick the brain instead of trying to fake intelligence by putting conditional codes that we ourselves have designed.

Unfortunately, we are not technologically advanced enough to build dynamic brains, but we can emulate a dynamic brain inside an algorithm that can run on a static brain. The dynamic gates will be imaginary entities inside a digital memory that can trigger other imaginary gates.

## Tunable gates

In order to have a solid and symmetric brain, which is able to learn without losing its uniform shape, we'll need cause/effect gates that are general purpose and can change their behavior.

We can model and-gate as a continuous function on floating point values! We can design a function such that returns 0 by default and approaches 1 only when both its input value are close to 1.

Why modelling a gate as a floating point function is beneficial for us? Because we can take derivative of a continuous function!
