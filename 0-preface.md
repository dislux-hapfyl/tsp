# The Super Programmer

## Intro

Legos were my favorite toys as a kindergarten student. It was one of the only toys I could use to build stuff that didn't exist before. It let me bring my imaginations into the real world, and nothing satisfies a curious mind more than the ability to build unique structures out of simple pieces.

Years later, seeing my cousin building robots by typing some characters on the screen and "programming" it into something he called a "microcontroller", triggered the same parts in my brain, as playing with lego pieces. I didn't know the English alphabet those days, so I was just seeing different symbols coming on the screen after every keystrokes. The fact that certain ordering of some symbols could cause some kind of unique behavior was blowing my mind. I would copy/paste the codes on my cousin's book on his computer for free, just to see that a behavior emerges when I put some kind of "cheat-code" on his computer. I began to appreciate the power of characters. Characters were my new lego pieces, but there was an important difference, it was impossible to run out of characters. I could literally use billions of them to build different behaviors.

After around 20 years, I still get super excited when I build something I find magnificent by putting the right symbols in the right order. I was curious enough to study and deeply understand many applications of computers that have made significant impact in our everyday life but nobody gives them the attention they deserve these days, so I decided to gather all these information in one place and write this book.

When I started writing this book, I was expecting it to be a merely technical book with a lot of codes included, targetting only programmers as its audience, but I ended up writing a lot of history, philosophy and even human anatomy! So the book could be a good read for non-programmers too!

The Super Programmer is all about ideas, and how they have evolved through time, leading to the impressive technology we have today. I wanted this book to have least dependency to technologies, so that the codes do not get obsolete over time. I first thought of writing the codes in some pseudo-coding language, but I personally believe that pseudo-codes are not coherent enough, so I decided to choose and stick with a popular language like Python, which as of today, is a programming language that is known by many other engineers and scientists.

Throughout this book, I’m going to show you the inspirations that human beings got from the nature, in order to build technology. Humans themselves have always been a great  source of inspiration for building tech. You are going to read the phrase “The Creator” in this book a lot of times. The Creator can have different meanings for different people. Religious people may interpret it as God, and people with materialistic views may interpret it as the nature and the process of evolution. Either way, there is no doubt that there has been immense amount of intelligence behind the mind who/which created life. Engineering ideas that The Creator used to build life has been a great source of inspiration for the technology we have today. In many parts of the book, we are going to put our feet into The Creator's shoe and try to understand what has been going in its/his mind when engineering us.

## Who is this book for?

This book is for curious people who are eager to learn some of the most fundamental topics of computer and software engineering. The topics presented in this books, although very interesting in opinion, are some of the most underrated and least discussed fields of computer programming. This book is about the old technology, the technology we are using everyday, but we refuse to learn and extend as an average engineer. The literature around each of those topics is so large that, only specialists will ever be motivated to learn them.

The Super Programmer is for the programmers who don't want to limit their knowledge and skills on a very narrow area of software engineering.

## How to make the most of this book?

The book is divided into 5 chapters. We will start by explaining the beauty of cause-and-effect chains, and how we can build useful and interesting structures by connecting simple lego pieces together. We will go through the history of transistors, how they work, and how we can simulate them using plain Python code. We will implement different logic gates by connecting transistors together, and will proceed to building more complicated circuits like adders, counters and finally, programmable computers. After building our super simple computer, we'll try to put a soul in it. We will introduce the Brainfuck programming language and how it can be compiled for our computer, and will try to design and implement impressibely complicated programs using this simple language.

In chapter 2 and 3, we'll discuss two of the most important human senses, the sense of hearing and vision. We will start with some history, explaining how how humans invented ways to record what they see or hear, as photos or tapes, and experience them later. Then we will see how the digital revolution changed the way we record and store media forever. We'll get deep on very simple computer file formats used for storing images and audio, and will try to generate them ourselves. We will learn how to please our ears and eyes by generating a bunch of bytes.

Chapter 4 is all about the cool parts of artificial intelligence. We will discuss how biological neurons are similar to tunable electronic gates, and how we can use calculus and differentiations to tune these gates. We will try to build a library for training neural networks by differentiating computation graphs. We will learn and implement some of the most import operations used in neural-network models that can understand language, and will try to implement a language model ourselves.

In the final chapter, we will learn how people can use math for bringing trust into their wild digital world. We will start by learning the history of cryptography, and how people can encrypt and sign digital documents with their digital identities. We will discuss the electronic-cash revolution and see how math can help us to save ourselves from the evil and escape some of the limitations governments put on us. We will discuss ways we can convincingly prove people that we know something, without revealing it, and see how we can use these methods for building truly private cryptocurrencies.

Without a doubt, people love things they have built on their own more than anything else. If you are planning to implement the codes in this book on your own, I suggest you to do it in a programming language other than Python. Writing the codes in Python might make you feel you are not doing anything new, and you may really end up copying and pasting what you read in the book. On the other hand, by rewriting all the logic in another language, you will force yourself to translate what you are reading, leading to a much deeper understanding of what is happening. It will also give you the feeling of creating something new, increasing your dopamine levels and motivation!
