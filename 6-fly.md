## Skip if you are poor

Throughout my career in software-engineering, I had always avoided topics which involved any interactions with the Physical world (Except a short period of time when I was working on line-following robots as a high-school student). That's partly because I live in an economically poor country, where there aren't a lot of companies building cyber-physical systems (Systems composed of a software, controlling/sensing a physical thing), except when politics is involved, if you know what I mean.

Unlike pure software engineering, where you can never run out of characters, building software that interacts with the real-world, involves physical objects, things that you can touch and feel, and the unfortunate truth about non-imaginary objects is that, they cost money, and they can break, which means, you can't experiment as much as a software with them (Unless you are a rich engineer, having a giant laboratory inside your house, with plenty of money)

I have never been that rich, and I also couldn't find any company doing respectful cyberphysical projects in my country either. Therefore I have never been a real fan of a section in computer science, known as ***embedded engineering***. You can see in this book that I'm a great fan of computer simulations though!
